## üíª Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or later
- Node.js 18 or later
- Git

### Local Development

# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sqlapp2.git
cd sqlapp2

# Set up upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/sqlapp2.git

# Backend development
./gradlew bootRun

# Frontend development (in another terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

# Backend tests
./gradlew test

# Frontend tests
cd frontend
npm test

# Integration tests
./gradlew integrationTest
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### Java/Spring Boot

- Follow [Spring Boot best practices](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/)
- Use proper exception handling
- Include JavaDoc for public methods
- Follow naming conventions:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Methods: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Package structure: `cherry.sqlapp2.*`

### TypeScript/React

- Use functional components with React Hooks
- Follow TypeScript strict mode
- Use proper typing (avoid `any`)
- Follow naming conventions:
  - Components: `PascalCase`
  - Variables/functions: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
- Use CSS classes with kebab-case

### Git Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: add user profile management
fix: resolve SQL injection vulnerability
docs: update API documentation
style: format code with prettier
refactor: improve connection pooling logic
test: add unit tests for authentication
chore: update dependencies
```

### Code Formatting

- **Java**: Use built-in IDE formatters or Checkstyle
- **TypeScript**: Use Prettier with provided configuration
- **CSS**: Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Backend Testing

- Unit tests for services and utilities
- Integration tests for controllers
- Use `@SpringBootTest` for integration tests
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and error scenarios

### Frontend Testing

- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for user workflows
- Test accessibility features

### Test Coverage

- Maintain minimum 80% test coverage
- Focus on critical business logic
- Include edge cases and error handling

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Backend Architecture

- Follow MVC pattern
- Use dependency injection
- Implement proper layering:
  - Controllers (REST endpoints)
  - Services (business logic)
  - Repositories (data access)
  - Entities (data models)

### Frontend Architecture

- Component-based architecture
- Use React Context for global state
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Separate UI logic from business logic

### Database Design

- Use JPA entities for internal H2 database
- Follow database naming conventions
- Include proper constraints and validations
- Document any schema changes

## üîí Security Considerations

- Never hardcode credentials or secrets
- Use parameterized queries for all database operations
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Include security tests for critical features

## üìö Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Include JavaDoc/JSDoc for new APIs
- Update ROADMAP.md for feature progress
- Add examples for complex features

## üîÑ Release Process

1. Features are merged to `main` branch
2. Version tags follow semantic versioning (v1.0.0)
3. Releases include changelog and migration notes
4. Docker images are built automatically
